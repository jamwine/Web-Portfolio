I am a Software Engineer with a master's in Computer Science and 4+ years of professional experience in working towards **data analysis** and **defining data-driven models** for actionable insights. I have a strong mathematical background with analytical and problem-solving skills. I excel in **automating back-end processes**, gathering raw data by **utilizing APIs**, and defining **Machine Learning models with visual animations**. My experience at USD, Zenatix, and Cognizant make me versatile in working *independently* as well as a *team player*.


I am always up for:
 - a cup of delicious coffee
 - dark chocolates
 - discovering new music: [J A M W I N E](https://jam-wine.tumblr.com/)
 - Stock Markets and investments
 - a game of Chess or Table Tennis
 - exploring Open Source Technologies: [Work With Data](https://workwithdata.tumblr.com/)
 - PC Gaming and eSports
 - Coursera MOOCs
 - discussion about new gadgets and PC configurations
 - Logo Designing
 - Traveling (*obviously* :sweat_smile:)
